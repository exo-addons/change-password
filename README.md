# changePassword


In some cases, we can generate passwords automatically and associate them to the users.  
With this addon, we will implement the change password at first login and when it is expired.
The password expiration months number is set by default to 6 months. You can externalize this parameter by
defining the key password.expiration.months.number in exo.properties file. For example:
password.expiration.months.number=7
